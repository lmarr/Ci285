#CI285---Funtional-Program

A simple based RESTful CALCULATOR made from yesod/haskell

To initialise the working program.

    Download the Zip folder
    Open terminal and look for the file - cd Haskell
    When in the directory type - stack build && stack exec haskell
    Now open the browser and type on the address bar - localhost:3000

You can now test

localhost:3000/home localhost:3000/add/15/2 localhost:3000/sub/15/2 localhost:3000/mul/15/2 localhost:3000/div/15/2

I use third party code from yesod book to get an idea of how we we're suppose to write this;
